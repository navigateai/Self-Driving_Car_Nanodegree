# Importance Weight

Let's say that we have a robot that is on a map with four landmarks. We have a particle that is close by the robot, but is not on the robot so it represents a prediction that is off by a bit. The mismatch of the actual and the predicted measurement leads to the **importance weight**. This importance weight tells us how important that specific particle is. The larger the weight, the more important it is.

We have many different particles and a specific measurement. Each of these particles will have a different weight. Some will look very plausible, while others will not which is indicated by the size of the circles of particles on the graph of the map with particles. We allow some of our particles on the map to survive randomly, but also proportional to their weights. The particles with larger weights will have a very high chance of survival, while the ones with low weights will have a low chance of survival. After what is called **resampling** which is the process of randomly drawing **N** new particles from these old ones with replacement in proportion to the importance weight.

After that resampling phase, the larger clouds of particles are very likely to live on, while the smaller ones will die off. The particles that are very consistent with the sensor measurement survive with higher probability, and the ones with lower importance weight tend to die out. This is why particles tend to cluster in clouds around regions of higher posterior probability.

To code this we have to have a method for setting the importance weights that is related to the likelihood of a measurement, and we have to set up a method for resampling that grabs particles in proportion to those weights. 

### Code

```python
# Now we want to give weight to our 
# particles. This program will print a
# list of 1000 particle weights.
